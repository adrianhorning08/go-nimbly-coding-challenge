# go-nimbly-coding-challenge

## Overview
Create a UI for web browsers that takes a user input, makes a callout to a 3rd-party API with user input, and displays the data below the user input and deploy it to Heroku

# Plan
I'm gonna do the weather one.
## MVP
* User inputs city and you get the forecast for the week
* Responsive
* Deployed to Heroku
## Implementation
I think I need a small backend to avoid CORS
## Advanced features
* Ask for your location
* Comes in in a cool animation
* Auto completes city

## 3rd party APIs for use
* https://robohash.org/
  Take some silly user input and display the silly robot alien generated.
* https://www.metaweather.com/api/
 Take some location information and display the weather in a nice way.
* https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/
 Take an account (email) and display how it’s been owned.
* https://newton.now.sh/
 Take an expression + operation and display the math in a beautiful way

## You Should:
* Look into the APIs, and spend some time coming up with a project for one (1-2 hours)
* Build a UI that takes in User input, and interacts with your API of choice (1-2 hours)
* Update the display to reflect the response from the API (1 hour)
* Host your application on Heroku (1-2 hours)

## Constraints
* Use the defined APIs
* Deploy the app to Heroku
* Title your app with your name *What do this mean???*

## Requirements
* Plan to spend 4-8 hours to complete. You can spend more time (or less, if this is really easy), but we don’t need you to go overboard!
* Submit your herokuapp link
* Submit your source code via attachment or link to repo

## Tips & Bonus
* Focus on writing readable code. We realize this is a little subjective, but try to keep it tidy
* Animations are nice. Show us what you can do with CSS!
* Have some fun with it
